* Pin `@esy-opam/esy-install` package to an exact version.

## 0.0.9

* Make escaping shell commands more robust.

## 0.0.8

* Support for converting opam package from opam repository directly.

  Previously we shipped preconverted metadata for opam packages. Now if you
  request `@opam-alpha/*` package we will convert it directly from opam
  repository.
